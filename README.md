Card Selection System

Arduino & Keil-based electronic card selection system

Project Overview

This project is an electronic bingo-style game where a sequence of random cards is displayed on the screen to start the game. Players can pause and resume the selection process at any time using a button. When a player wins, all previously displayed cards are shown again on the screen to verify the winning sequence.".

The project was developed on both Arduino and Keil microcontroller platforms, demonstrating flexibility in embedded system design.

Features

✅ Random card generation – Displays symbols representing different card suits.
✅ User interaction – Buttons allow pausing the selection process.
✅ Potentiometer control – Adjusts parameters such as speed.
